Project description

My project is supposed to simulate an online shop designed for hamsters.
It consists of 5 GUI forms created in swing ui.

Registration form
Has 4 mandatory fields (Username, Email, Password and Confirm password). The phone field is optional, 
a user can register without entering it. On clicking "register", the phone(if exists) and email fields will be checked for 
correct format, also the password fields must match. If all the data is correct a new line will be created in table "account".

Login form
Has 2 fields for username and password. It checks if the credentials entered exist in the "account table". If the account is not 
found, an error message is displayed.

Catalogue
This serves as the main page. It displayes the current logged in user, a 'log out' button, which takes you back to the login form.
It also shows a list of hamsters. For each type, it checks the available ammount in the database table "breed" and,
if the number is greater than 0 it displays a text field for entering the quantity. When clicking the 'Place order' button,
then final price will be calculated, the ammounts will be checked (must be numbers smaller than the available stock) and the "OrderAdressForm"
will be displayed.

OrderAdressForm
It displays the price of an order and has 4 fields corresponding to the City, Street, Nr, Ap (last one is optional). After entering an adress,
and clicking confirom order, a new entry will be added in table "orders" with all the relevant information (User, adress, price and content).

AdminConsole
If the logged in user is an admin, the Catalogue will also have an "Admin console" button, which leads to this form.
Here, the admin can modify the stock for each hamster type(add or remove hamsters), or ban any non-admin account.
